# Trees

## Introduction 
A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of each node pointing simply to the next node in a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an example of a non linear data structure.
A tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.

1) The set of all nodes at a given depth is called the <b>level</b> of the tree. The root node is at level zero (eg. Nodes B, C and D lie at level 1)
2) The <b>depth of a node</b> is the length of the path from the root to the node (eg. depth of G is 2, A – C – G).
3) The <b>height of a node</b> is the length of the path from that node to the deepest node. The height of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree(eg. the height of B is 2, B – F – J)
