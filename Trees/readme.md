# Trees

## Introduction 
A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of each node pointing simply to the next node in a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an example of a non linear data structure.
A tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.
