Some of the commonly used data structures are :-
1) Stacks 
2) Queues 
3) Linked List
4) Tree
5) Graphs

### A few noteworthy points :- 
1) Pointers always take up 8 bytes of space in 64 bit architecture 
2) Struct invloves padding while allocating memory , so even a struct of an int and char takes 8 bytes , while the struct of char takes 1 byte
