# The Data Structures and Algorithm Saga 
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. In simple words, data structures are just a way to represent data in memory which makes storing, operating on them etc very efficient.

Some of the commonly used data structures are :-
1) Stacks 
2) Queues 
3) Linked List
4) Tree
5) Graphs

### A few noteworthy points :- 
1) Pointers always take up 8 bytes of space in 64 bit architecture 
2) Struct involves padding while allocating memory , so even a struct of an int and char takes 8 bytes , while the struct of char takes 1 byte 

### Doubts :- 
1) How to free nodes in adj list after use ?
