## Greedy Algorithms

## Introduction
A greedy algorithm builds a solution piece by piece and at each step, chooses the most profitable piece. Some of the algorithms based on greedy choice are Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.

A greedy algorithm chooses the local optimals in hope of finding the global global. Greedy algorithms sometimes fail to find the globally optimal solution because they usually do not operate exhaustively on all the data. They can make commitments to certain choices too early, preventing them from finding the best overall solution later.
