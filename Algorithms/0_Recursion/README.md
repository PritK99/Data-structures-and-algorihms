# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is when a function calls itself either directly or indirectly. Typically the function performs some part of the task and rest is delegated to the recursive call of the same function, hence, there are multiple instances of same function each performing some part of the overall task. Function stops calling itself when a terminating condition is reached.

The two components of recursion are:-

* Base case: This is the terminating case
* Recursive case: Recursive function performs some part of task and delegate rest of it to the recursive call.
