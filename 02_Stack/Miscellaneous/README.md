## 1) Bracket Balancing 
Here, we are trying to implement a code to test if the brackets are balanced.

This code not only inform the user that there is an error in the usage of brackets, but also point to the exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. 
First priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesnâ€™t have an opening bracket before it. Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks.
