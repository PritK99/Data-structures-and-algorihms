## Sorting Algorithms

### <b>1) Selection Sort</b>

Selection sort is a <b>comparison based sorting algorithm</b>.

In selection sort,we first find the minimum element in the given array. Then we swap the minimum element with the first element.We then repeat the above steps for remaining array.


### <b>2) Merge Sort</b>
Merge sort is a <b>comparison based sorting algorithm</b> based on <b>divide and conquer</b> technique.

In merge sort, we split the given array recursively and then sort them indivisually and merge them back.

## <b>Conclusion</b>

The time complexities of a few sorting algorithms are given below
