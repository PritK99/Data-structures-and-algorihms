# Greedy Algorithms

## Introduction
A greedy algorithm builds a solution piece by piece and at each step, chooses the most profitable piece according to given optimal sub-structure. Some of the algorithms based on greedy choice are Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Points to note
* Greedy algorithms sometimes fail to find the globally optimal solution because they usually do not operate exhaustively on all the data. They can make commitments to certain choices too early, preventing them from finding the best overall solution later.
