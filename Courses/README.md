# Courses

This folder contains all the online courses I have done on platforms such as coursera, youtube etc.

For all certification courses, I have uploaded my solutions to assignments. These solutions even though correct, may not be optimized. At times I get lazy zzz..............

But I would love to learn better and more optimized solutions for all these problems.

## Algorithms on graph 

Algorithms on Graphs is a course by University of California San Diego on coursera.
